Hi, there! I am Zilin Kang(康梓林), currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at CS department of Tsinghua University, China. I am interested in reinforcement learning for both robotic tasks and LLMs.

Currently I am working in [TEA Lab](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/Research/Research_Groups/Tsinghua_Embodied_AI_Lab.htm) (Tsinghua Embodied AI Lab) under the supervision of Prof. [Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks). My academic interests lie in developing efficient reinforcement learning algorithms and applying them to real-world robotic tasks and large language models.

If you want to know more about me, feel free to check out my publications, CV or contact me via email at [kzl22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:kzl22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).
